Thank you for signing up to start a Brigade! Weâ€™re excited to help you organize in your community. 

Code for America Brigades organize through the four Ps: people, plans, partnerships, and participation. 

A group can join the Code for America Brigade network as a Brigade Network Member or an Official Brigade Chapter.

What to do next
Your first step in starting a Brigade is to get your people together! This includes:
* Organizing a core leadership team
* Putting up a website that includes a Code of Conduct
* Hosting three consistent hack nights

Once you've done that, we will invite you to participate in the Brigade Network channels where you can connect with Brigades around the world to learn and to share your experiences with them.

Want access to funding and additional resources?
If you want to become an Official Brigade Chapter and receive funding and additional resource and support, you'll need a plan and partners. This includes:
* Writing a strategic plan that maps to the Code for America Principles
* Building partnerships with community groups and local government

If you are joining from outside the United States, you can participate in the Brigade network, too. Find out more at codeforall.org.
