Thanks for signing up to organize in your community.

The next step for you and your team is to watch the recorded Hangout, which walks you through the initial process of starting a Brigade.

Then, you will want to browse through our support materials located at http://codeforamerica.org/brigade/tools

Please reach out to us if you have any questions, and have fun as you start building you civic-tech community!

Thanks again and talk to you soon.
