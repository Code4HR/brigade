<p>Thank you for signing up to start a Brigade! Weâ€™re excited to help you organize in your community.</p>

<p>Code for America Brigades organize through the four Ps: people, plans, partnerships, and participation. </p>

<p>What to do next</p>

<p>Your first step in starting a Brigade is to get your people together! This includes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Organizing a <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/document/d/1oEB1CuzCHldxP_bzcvmcrmK0yAE1BzV2AGhtwtYKZVY/edit">core leadership team</a></li>
	<li>Putting up a website that includes a <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fcodeforamerica%2Fcodeofconduct&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHLV1eOOQEJLnypprXD_lXHMlg58g">Code of Conduct</a></li>
	<li>Hosting three consistent <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/document/d/1ukivPQNeIH2GcJHcZ50yjzh1uQj70FlilFQcUKOH49k/edit">hack nights</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
Once you've done that, we will invite you to participate in the Brigade Network channels where you can connect with Brigades around the world to learn and to share your experiences with them.
