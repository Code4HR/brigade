%h4 FAQ

%p Q: “What if my city already has an open gov group, leadership structure, or I belong to another open government group?"

%p A: That's awesome -- ideal really. We want to support and celebrate your efforts however possible. We want to link together our civic hacking communities. For the sake of communication though we'd like for one individual to apply to become a Captain. You can also rotate the responsibility throughout the year and share responsibilities.
