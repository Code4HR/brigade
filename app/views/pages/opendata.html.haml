      %h1 Liberate civic data and build civic digital libraries!
%p Open government data increases trust in government, reduces friction in processes, and leads to economic development through new technologies and companies.
%p Civic data informs important things like your commute, where you buy a house, how your city spends money, and what's happening in your city. But most civic data is consistently inaccessible to the public online without added cost. And the public now includes developers who want to use civic data to deliver software that improves interfaces to government.
%p Civic data does not free itself. It needs you to liberate it.
%p Hereâ€™s how you can join us in opening civic data where you live:
%ol
  %li Find out whether or not there is an open data portal where you live using the links below. If there isn't an open data portal where you live, <a title="email brigade-info, subject: Open Data Portal Needed!" href="mailto:brigade-info@codeforamerica.org?subject=Open Data Portal Needed!&body=We need an open data portal in [YOUR CITY HERE]">let us know via email</a>. We might need to <a title="deploy civic software activity" href="/applications">deploy an open data portal</a> or <a title="start an open gov initiative activity" href="pages/ogi">start an open government initiative</a>
  %li If there is an open data portal then put closed data into it. If you've never done that before you'll want some help. <a title="email brigade-info, subject: I Need Help Liberating Civic Data!?body=I live in [YOUR CITY HERE]." href="mailto:brigade-info@codeforamerica.org?subject=I Need Help Liberating Civic Data!">Let us know if that's the case</a>,  and check out our resources below.
  %li Whenever you liberate data <a title="email brigade-info, subject: Civic Data was Liberated!" href="mailto:brigade-info@codeforamerica.org?subject=Civic Data was Liberated!">send us this email</a>.
  %li Get your friends to join Brigade and show their support for your activity.
  %li Plan an event for your activity. Use our <a title="our meetup everywhere page" href="http://www.meetup.com/cfabrigade">MeetUp Everywhere</a>.
