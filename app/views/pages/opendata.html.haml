%h1 Build civic digital libraries
%p Open data increases trust in government, reduces friction in processes, and leads to creative development of new technologies. But data does not free itself. It needs you to liberate it.
%p Here’s how you can join us in opening civic data where you live:
%ol
  %li Click “Open Civic Data” on the Activities page [LINK] and follow the steps. You’ll be asked to assign the activity to a Brigade or to start a new Brigade.
  %li Use the social media buttons to let everyone know right away about your deployment. We’ll also get an alert through <a href="mailto:brigade-info@codeforamerica.org">brigade-info@codeforamerica.org</a> so that each month we can share all the new activities with the Brigade community and through our newsletter.
  %li Get your friends to join your Brigade to show their support for your activity. Be sure to ask them to also using the social media buttons.
  %li Plan an event for your activity. Use our MeetUp or whichever service you prefer. Just be sure to let us know about it so we can spread the word.
