    <h1>Playbook, Calendar, and Workshops</h1>

    <p>Over the past four years, we’ve learned a lot about what works when organizing a Brigade. We’ve compiled a playbook to highlight some of the best practices Brigades can use to help build <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/practices/" target="_blank">21st century government</a> in their city.</p>

    <h2>Calendar</h2>
    <p>This calendar highlights our recommendations for when Brigades should focus on certain activities from the <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/practices/" target="_blank">playbook</a>. Often Brigades will be participating in multiple activities at once and many activities continue throughout the course of a year. Some activities like days of action or civic user testing will also require prep ahead of when they’re scheduled.</p>
