    <h2><center>How It All Began</center></h2>

    <p>In 2012, the Captains (Spike (above) and Eddie (below)) originally met through the Code for America network, saying they chose each other as mentors, and began collaborating to do work in the city they both love. They believe strongly in the Code for America model for transforming local government and want to bring it to a local level in Oakland. They began by hosting hackathons, which they found were good for building community, but not for building sustainable technology. While continuing to host larger events, they have also started a more regular meeting model. OpenOakland began by meeting monthly, then biweekly, and now weekly. <br> <br> OpenOakland first met at the Urban Strategies Council offices, then the Oakland Tribune offices, but when <a href="https://www.codeforamerica.org/people/nicole-neditch/" target="_blank">Nicole Neiditch,</a> former Online Engagement Manager for the City of Oakland, now Code for America Fellowship Director, got involved she invited the group to City Hall. They now meet every Tuesday at 6:30 in a hearing room on the first floor of City Hall. They’re still finding a balance of getting participation from city staff with meeting at a time that’s after work hours. There are a few city staff that regularly attend, but even without a huge amount of city staff participation, they’re finding that social awareness is helping to build support. <br> <br>In late 2013, OpenOakland members asked the organization for more leadership capacity to take on all of the opportunities presented to the group. Choosing participants who consistently engaged, OpenOakland formed a core leadership team of approximately 20 volunteers.  <br> <br> They meet Tuesdays, at 6:30pm in a Hearing Room on the first floor of City Hall. </p>
