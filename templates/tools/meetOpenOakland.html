    <h2><center>How It All Began</center></h2>

    <p>In 2012, the Captains (Spike (above) and Eddie (below)) originally met through the Code for America network, saying they chose each other as mentors, and began collaborating to do work in the city they both love. They believe strongly in the Code for America model for transforming local government and want to bring it to a local level in Oakland. They began by hosting hackathons, which they found were good for building community, but not for building sustainable technology. While continuing to host larger events, they have also started a more regular meeting model. OpenOakland began by meeting monthly, then biweekly, and now weekly. <br> <br> OpenOakland first met at the Urban Strategies Council offices, then the Oakland Tribune offices, but when <a href="https://www.codeforamerica.org/people/nicole-neditch/" target="_blank">Nicole Neiditch,</a> former Online Engagement Manager for the City of Oakland, now Code for America Fellowship Director, got involved she invited the group to City Hall. They now meet every Tuesday at 6:30 in a hearing room on the first floor of City Hall. They’re still finding a balance of getting participation from city staff with meeting at a time that’s after work hours. Several city staff that regularly attend, including current City Online Engagement Manager, Mai-Ling Garcia (below), but even without a huge amount of city staff participation, they’re finding that social awareness is helping to build support. <br> <br>In late 2013, OpenOakland members asked the organization for more leadership capacity to take on all of the opportunities presented to the group. Choosing participants who consistently engaged, OpenOakland formed a core leadership team of approximately 20 volunteers.  <br> <br> They meet Tuesdays, at 6:30pm in a Hearing Room on the first floor of City Hall. </p>

	<h2><center>OpenDisclosure</center></h2>
	<P>
	<a href="http://www.opendisclosure.io/" target="_blank"><font color="black">Open Disclosure</font></a> is a web application that brings transparency to campaign financing. <br><br>
 	In 2014, OpenOakland partnered with the Oakland <a href="http://www2.oaklandnet.com/Government/o/CityAdministration/d/PublicEthics/index.htm" target="_blank"><font color="black">Public Ethics Commission</font></a>  to ensure accurate data of the 2014 
	Oakland Mayoral election was available and ask key questions such as,  “who are the top campaign contributors?” and “what percentage of campaign contributions to each mayoral candidate 
	are made from Oakland residents vs. others?” <br><br>

	The team used <a href="https://github.com/openoakland/opendisclosure/issues" target="_blank"><font color="black">Github</font></a> for sharing code and having conversations about the data and questions. They work mostly in two teams, 
	one building the front end visualizations in D3, which they are teaching themselves, and a back-end process team 
	figuring out how to streamline getting the data into an open format.
