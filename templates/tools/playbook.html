    <h2>Brigade Organizer's Playbook</h2>
    <p>The Brigade Organizer’s Playbook works with the <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/tools/calendar/">Brigade Organizer's Calendar</a> as a resource for Brigades to frame out their organizing activities for the year.</p>
    <p>The playbook focuses the three areas key to running sustainable Brigade: infrastructure, organizing, and building. </p> 
    <p>This playbook is an MVP. We will continue to iterate on it throughout 2016. Please ping us on Slack or via email with feedback and new plays you’d like to see added.</p>
