    <h2><center>The Opportunity</center></h2>

    	<p>Are you interested in softwae development, and have some intorudctory HTML and CSS skills but no where to code?</p>
    	
    		<div class="layout-minim">
		If <b>YES</b> keep reading! You should join the mentorship program! 
		</div>
		
  		<div class="layout-minim">
  		If <b>YES</b>...and you feel like your HTML and CSS could still use some support, keep reading anyway, then sign up for some classes at your local <a href="https://www.girldevelopit.com/" target="_blank">Local GDI Chapter</a>and come back here when your ready! keep reading! You should join the mentorship program! 	
    		</div>
    		
    <P>Tho goal of the Mentorship Program is for women who have intro-intermediate developer skills to level up by hacking on Code for America Brigade projects. </P>
    
    <h2><center>How it Works</center></h2>
    
    	<p>In truth, anyone anytime can join their local Code for America Brigadeand hack on projects.<a href="https://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade" target="_blank"> JOIN US!</a></p>
    
    	<p>But this year, in the cities noted below, Brgade Captains are partnering with their local GDI Chapters to offer women with basic tech skills a chance to hack and learn along side a speficied mentor.</p>
    	
    	<p>Our mentors are all volunteers who already hack on data at their Brigade meetups and want to help YOU apply your knowledge while coding on <a href="https://www.codeforamerica.org/geeks/civicissues" target="_blank">projects that impact your local community.</a></p>
    	</P>
    	
    	<p> This brilliant idea of merging Brigades with GDI came from Philly, where the Brigade <a href="https://codeforphilly.org/" target="_blank">Code for Philly </a> and their local GDI Chapter piloted this mentorship program during 2014, calling it the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Girl-Develop-It-Philadelphia/events/182875742/"> target="_blank">"Summer of Open Source."</a>  You can read about the details on the <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/2014/10/13/want-to-take-your-brigade-to-the-next-level-develop-it/" target=_blank>Code for America blog</a>, among many other places like <a href="http://technical.ly/philly/2014/05/30/girl-develop-it-open-source-fellowship/"> target="_blank"> Technical.ly </a> that picked up on the story.<br>
    	Or, you can sing up below and have your own great tale to tell. Like LeAnne, and the 10 women below, all part of the Summer of Open Source 2014.</p>
