    <h2><center>The Opportunity</center></h2>

    	<p>Are you interested in softwae development, and have some intorudctory HTML and CSS skills but no where to code?</p>
    	
    		<div class="layout-minim">
		If <b>YES</b> keep reading! You should join the mentorship program! 
		</div>
		
  		<div class="layout-minim">
  		If <b>YES</b>...and you feel like your HTML and CSS could still use some support, keep reading anyway, then sign up for some classes at your local <a href="https://www.girldevelopit.com/" target="_blank">Local GDI Chapter</a>and come back here when your ready! keep reading! You should join the mentorship program! 	
    
    <P>Tho goal of the Mentorship Program is for women who have intro-intermediate developer skills to level up by hacking on Code for America Brigade projects. </P>
    
    <h2><center>How it Works</center></h2>
    
    	<p>In truth, anyone anytime can join their local Code for America Brigadeand hack on projects.<a href="https://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade" target="_blank">JOIN US!</a></p>
    
    	<p>But this year, in the cities noted below, Brgade Captains are partnering with their local GDI Chapters to offer women with basic tech skills a chance to hack and learn along side a speficied mentor.</p>
    	
    	<p>Our mentors are all volunteers who already hack on data at their Brigade meetups and want to help YOU apply your knowledge while coding on <a href="https://www.codeforamerica.org/geeks/civicissues" target="_blank">projects that impact your local community.</a></p>
    	</P>
    	
    	<p> This brilliant idea of merging Brigades with GDI came from Philly, where they piloted this mentorship program during 2014, calling it the "Summer of Open Source."  You can read about the details on the Code for America blog, among many other places like Technical.ly that picked up on the story.<br>
    	Or, you can sing up below and have your own great tale to tell. Like LeAnne, and the 10 women below, all part of the Summer of Open Source 2014.</p>
