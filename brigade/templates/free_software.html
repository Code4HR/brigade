    <p>Below, you’ll find a list of what’s available to your Brigade!</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>If you require a code</strong>, email inkinds@codeforamerica.org to request one.</li>
      <li><strong>If you’re a Brigade member</strong>, please also CC your Brigade captain on any email to inkinds@codeforamerica.org.</li>
      <li><strong>If you have any questions</strong>, <a href="mailto:inkinds@codeforamerica.org">send us an email</a> or <a href="http://slack.codeforamerica.org" target="_blank">ping us on Slack</a> (@brigade-info).
      </li>

    <p>Thanks for everything you do - happy building!</p>

    <h3>Cloud Hosting</h3>

    <h4>Heroku</h4>
    <h5>What is Heroku?</h5>
    <p>Heroku is a simple, easy-to-use cloud hosting service!</p>

    <h5>What do you get?</h5>
    <p>We’re delighted to be able to offer access to our Brigades on a per-project basis.</p>

    <h5>How do you get access?</h5>
    <p>Email us at inkinds@codeforamerica.org with the subject "Heroku request". Please include the following details about your project:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Project name and a short description
        <ul>
          <li>Who is your target user?</li>
          <li>When do you hope to release your project? (This can be a very rough estimate.)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The contact information for the lead developer on the project</li>
      <li>What is the estimated monthly cost for hosting your project?</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>AWS (Amazon Web Services)</h4>

    <h5>What is Amazon Web Services?</h5>
    <p>AWS is <em>the</em> "the cloud", including server hosting and high-powered tools to deploy and scale a successful project. AWS has donated credits to CfA which we are happy to share with your Brigade to get your projects hosted.</p>
    <p>Please note: AWS credits is a pilot program for Brigades, and we might have to end this program at the end of 2018 depending on the continued availability of donated credits.</p>

    <h5>What do you get?</h5>
    <p>If approved, CfA will give your brigade a $100 budget to spend on whatever it needs. We know this doesn’t go very far, so, above this threshold, we are happy to support promising projects on a case-by-case basis. To request a higher budget, reach out as described in "Any project-specific requests" below.</p>

    <h5>How do you get access?</h5>
    <p>Create an account on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">the AWS site</a> named after your brigade. (To simplify record-keeping on our end, we require that your Brigade only have a single AWS account.)</p>

    <p>If you have an existing account, make sure the Account Name is the name of your brigade.</p>

    <img src="/static/images/software_aws_account.png" />

    <p>This is what the account details should look like. Finally, send the Account ID number to <a href="mailto:inkinds@codeforamerica.org">inkinds@codeforamerica.org</a> along with the following information:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Your role within the Brigade</li>
      <li>Your monthly budget request (omit if requesting $100 or less)</li>
      <li>
        Any project-specific requests (omit if requesting $100 or less)
        <ul>
          <li>What is the project!? Tell us about who the project will help, and what it needs to be successful.</li>
          <li>The name and email address of the project’s lead developer</li>
          <li>Estimated release date of the project (It can be a very rough estimate.)</li>
          <li>Estimated budget of the project</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </p>

    <h5>What’s the catch?</h5>
    <p>No catches! But there are a couple things to be aware of.</p>

    <p>AWS payments are in a pilot stage of CfA. We will update you with information about the duration of the pilot when you send your request to inkinds@codeforamerica.org.</p>

    <p>Your AWS account will be added as a sub-account of Code for America’s main account, which means that CfA will be on the hook for any bills that you create. To make sure we are able to distribute the credits fairly across all the brigades and prevent accidental billing issues, we will require the ability to audit your AWS account and set up billing alerts.</p>

    <p>If your account goes over its agreed budget, we reserve the right to request that you pay back the difference, or to deduct it from your brigade account at CfA.</p>


    <h4>Microsoft Bizspark / Azure</h4>
    <h5>What is Bizspark / Azure?</h5>
    <p>BizSpark is a program that Microsoft offers to small organizations which includes many common Microsoft products and free Azure credits for hosting.</p>

    <h5>What do you get?</h5>
    <p>Through Bizspark, your Brigade will get 12 months of many Microsoft products including Microsoft Office, Microsoft Developer Network (including Visual Studio and SQL Server), and Microsoft Windows.</p>

    <p>In addition, up to five of your developers will receive a $150 monthly credit for Microsoft Azure that they can apply to their project.</p>

    <h5>How do you get access?</h5>
    <p>Request a code from inkinds@codeforamerica.org and <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3PbZqwhK6atRnBLMUJCWDBkb1hKVVVmOFJibXZ6VzJ0alk0/view">follow these instructions!</a></p>

    <h3>Communications</h3>
    <!--
      TODO: Pending approval on the G Suite plan from CxO

    <h4>G Suite (Google Apps for your domain)</h4>
    <h5>What is G Suite?</h5>
    <p>G Suite is Google’s hosted product featuring all the Google Apps you’ve come to love: Gmail, Google Drive, Google Groups, and many more.</p>

    <h5>What do you get?</h5>
    <p>Users of G Suite for Nonprofits receive access to all Google Apps like Gmail, Drive, and Groups (up to 30 GB of file storage). The email service can be tied to a custom domain for your Brigade.</p>

    <h5>How to get access?</h5>
    <p>We can set you up as an organization underneath CfA’s G Suite for free. Email <a href="mailto:inkinds@codeforamerica.org">inkinds@codeforamerica.org</a> and we will get you set up. In order for this to work, we will need to transfer your domain name to CfA’s registrar, and we will walk you through that process by email.</p>
    -->

    <h4>Slack</h4>
    <h5>What is Slack?</h5>
    <p>Slack is a group communication platform built around chat channels. (You can join Code for America’s at <a href="http://slack.codeforamerica.org" target="_blank">slack.codeforamerica.org</a> if you want to learn more!) Slack typically only offers one nonprofit plan per organization, but some brigades have had success applying for their own nonprofit plan. Your mileage may vary.</p>

    <h5>What can I get for free?</h5>
    <p>Slack offers a generous free tier to anyone that includes support for unlimited users with a fixed quota of storage space for messages and files. When you hit the limit, old messages and files are automatically deleted.</p>

    <p>Got questions about Slack? Please ping/email Christopher Whitaker! If you need to invite somebody to Slack, have them fill out this <a href="https://cfa.typeform.com/to/RfZuFF">form.</a></p>
